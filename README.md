# Waterbound

> "Who needs air when water feels like home?"

Waterbound is a revolutionary Fabric mod that completely inverts the survival experience:
- 💧 Breathe only underwater - Your natural habitat is now beneath the waves
- 🏜️ Suffocate on land - The surface world becomes your greatest threat

No mobs or underwater structures are effected, this is purely a player-centric transformation that flips everything you know upside down.

## Features

- 🫁 Water is your air, air is your enemy
- 🌧️ Breathe freely during rainstorms
- ⚒️ No mining speed penalty while submerged
- 💦 Drinking water bottles or potions refills oxygen
- 🌱 Craftable glow ink saplings that can grow underwater
- 🕯️ Glow ink torches that function underwater
- 🐬 Flippers item that boost your swimming speed
- 🌊 Submerged world preset that raises water level by 20 blocks

## Why Waterbound?

Because walking on land is so overrated! Every dive feels like true survival, and the pressure from the depths feel nicer than gravity.

The surface is loud but the depths are calm, it's so relaxing! For now...
