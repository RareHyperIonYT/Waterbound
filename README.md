# Waterbound

Waterbound is a tiny Fabric mod that flips breathing upside down:
- 💧 Only breathe underwater
- 🏜️ Choke on land or in bubble columns

No mobs, items, or underwater structures get affected, this is strictly a player-only stunt!

## Why Waterbound?

Because walking on land is overrated... and every dive feels like true survival.

*Made for adventurers who prefer their toes wet.* 🌊
